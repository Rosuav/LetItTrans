Bien sûr que je ne veux plus l'aider. En fait...
[Of course I do not want help. In fact...]

It's this way?
Est-ce que c'est par là?
[Does it mean?]

00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,199
"She'll die on her own."
"Mais seule elle risque de mourir."
[" But alone it may die."]

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,084
I can live with that. - Here we go.
Ça me dérange pas. - Oui, c'est ça.
[It doest not matter to me. - Yes that's it.]

00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,319
"But you won't get your new sled if she's dead."
"Mais tu n'auras pas ton traineau tout neuf si elle meurt."
[" But you do not have your brand new sled if she dies."]

00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,931
I think, actually, it's up.
Je pense que c'est un peu plus loin.

Je veux dire, c'est d'accord. Je vous laisse m'accompagner.
[I mean, that's okay. I leave you with me.]

00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,205

It's completely frozen.
Tout le pays est sous la neige.
[The whole country is under snow.]

This way to the North Mountain?
C'est par là, la montagne du nord?

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,599
More like this way.
Non, c'est plutôt dans cette direction.
[No, it's more in that direction.]

It really is beautiful, isn't it?
Non, c'est vrai. C'est magnifique.
[No it is true. That's wonderful.]

00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,361
But it's so white.
Mais tout est si blanc.
[But everything is so white.]

00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,610
You know, how about a little color?
Oh, faudrait y mettre un peu de couleur.
[Oh, would put a little color.]

00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,999
I'm thinking maybe some crimson, chartreuse.
Je sais pas moi, du rouge vermillon, ou du vert sapin.
[I know myself, the vermilion red, green or fir.]

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,645
How about yellow?
Ou encore du jaune?
[Or yellow?]

00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,963
No, not yellow. Yellow and snow?
Ah. Non, non, non, non, non. Pas jaune. Du jaune sur la neige?
[Ah. No, no, no, no, no. No yellow. Yellow on snow?]

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,479
No go.
Brrr! Non, ça va pas du tout.
[Brrr! No, it's not.]

00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,930
Am I right?
J'ai pas raison?
[I not right?]

00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,239
You're creepy.
C'est trop pour moi.
[It is too much for me.]

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,639
I don't want it.
Gardez.
[Keep.]

Back at you. - Please don't drop me.
J'en peux pas. - Pitié, arrêtez.
[I can not. - Please, stop.]

Come on, it's just a head.
Ça va, ce n'est qu'une tête.
