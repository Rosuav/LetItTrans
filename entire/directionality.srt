00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,639
Born of cold and winter air

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,999
And mountain rain combining

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,159
This icy force both foul and fair

00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,679
Has a frozen heart worth mining

00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,559
So cut through the heart

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,039
Cold and clear

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,159
Strike for love and strike for fear

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,091
See the beauty sharp and sheer

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,039
Split the ice apart

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,040
And break the frozen heart

00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,488
Watch your step! Let it go!

00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,968
Hup, ho

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,761
Watch your step! Let it go!

00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,999
Beautiful! Powerful!

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,359
Dangerous! Cold!

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,679
Ice has a magic can't be controlled

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,919
Stronger than one

00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,281
Stronger than ten

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,039
Stronger than a hundred men!

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,399
Oh!

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,839
Born of cold and winter air

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,159
And mountain rain combining

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,559
This icy force both foul and fair

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,445
Has a frozen heart worth mining

00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,719
Cut through the heart

00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,919
Cold and clear

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,282
Strike for love and strike for fear

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,802
There's beauty and there's danger here

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,122
Split the ice apart

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,410
Beware the frozen heart

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,127
Come on, Sven.

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,685
Elsa. Psst!

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,565
Elsa!

00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,888
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up!

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,521
Anna, go back to sleep.

00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,008
I just can't.

00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,125
The sky is awake, so I'm awake.

00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,279
So, we have to play.

00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,239
Go play by yourself.

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,448
Do you want to build a snowman?

00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,039
Come on, come on, come on!

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,049
Do the magic! Do the magic!

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,686
Oh...

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,129
- Ready? - Uh-huh.

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,329
This is amazing!

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,411
Watch this!

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,839
Hi, I'm Olaf, and I like warm hugs.

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,644
I love you, Olaf!

00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,084
Olaf...

00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,601
Tickle bumps!

00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,046
Oh!

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,761
Hang on!

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,039
Catch me!

00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,079
Gotcha!

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,486
Again!

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,801
Wait!

00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,687
- Whoo-hoo! - Slow down!

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,839
Whoo!

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,246
Anna!

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,726
Anna!

00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,243
Mama! Papa!

00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,404
No, no...

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,399
You're okay, Anna. I got you.

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,046
Elsa, what have you done?

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,130
This is getting out of hand.

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,599
It was an accident. I'm sorry, Anna!

00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,299
Oh. She's ice cold.

00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,565
I know where we have to go.

00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,646
Ice?

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,119
Faster, Sven.

00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,321
Sven!

00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,282
Please! Help! It's my daughter.

00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,679
It's the king.

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,439
Trolls?

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,005
Shush! I'm trying to listen.

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,171
Cuties. I'm going to keep you.

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,645
Your Majesty.

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,679
Born with the powers, or cursed?

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,201
Born. And they're getting stronger.

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,731
Here, here.

00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,564
You are lucky it wasn't her heart.

00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,930
The heart is not so easily changed.

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,726
But the head can be persuaded.

00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,610
Do what you must.

00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,286
I recommend we remove all magic.

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,042
Even memories of magic, to be safe.

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,009
But don't worry. I'll leave the fun.

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,411
She will be okay.

00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,088
But she won't remember I have powers?

00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,959
It's for the best.

00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,484
Listen to me, Elsa. Your power will only grow.

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,039
There is beauty in it...

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,359
But also great danger.

00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,881
You must learn to control it.

00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,763
Fear will be your enemy.

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,761
No!

00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,319
We'll protect her.

00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,599
She can learn to control it. I'm sure.

00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,159
Until then...

00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,044
We'll lock the gates.

00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,599
We'll reduce the staff.

00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,087
We will limit her contact with people,

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,244
and keep her powers hidden from everyone.

00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,370
Including Anna.

00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,566
Elsa?

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,045
Do you wanna build a snowman?

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,847
Come on, let's go and play

00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,803
I never see you any more

00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,246
Come out the door

00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,006
It's like you've gone away

00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,121
We used to be best buddies, and now we're not

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,201
I wish you would tell me why

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,166
Do you wanna build a snowman?

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,959
It doesn't have to be a snowman

00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,719
Go away, Anna.

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,730
Okay, bye

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,091
The gloves will help.

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,479
See? Conceal it.

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,119
Don't feel it.

00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,924
Don't let it show.

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,639
Do you wanna build a snowman?

00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,959
Or ride our bike around the halls?

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,159
I think some company is overdue

00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,199
I've started talking to the pictures on the walls

00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,279
Hang in there, Joan.

00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,962
It gets a little lonely, all these empty rooms

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,891
Just watching the hours tick by

00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,159
I'm scared.

00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,239
It's getting stronger!

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,079
Getting upset only makes it worse. Calm down.

00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,879
No! Don't touch me!

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,208
Please, I don't want to hurt you.

00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,884
See you in two weeks!

00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,161
Do you have to go?

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,569
You'll be fine, Elsa.

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,525
Your Highness.

00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,841
Elsa?

00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,087
Please, I know you're in there

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,647
People are asking where you've been

00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,529
They say "Have courage", and I'm trying to

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,799
I'm right out here for you

00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,207
Just let me in

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,250
We only have each other; it's just you and me

00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,771
What are we gonna do?

00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,440
Do you wanna build a snowman?

00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,279
All ashore!

00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,599
Welcome to Arendelle!

00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,799
Ahh, merci, monsieur.

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,239
Watch your step, please.

00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,999
The gates will be opening soon.

00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,919
Why do I have to wear this?

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,159
Because the queen has come of age.

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,999
It's Coronation Day!

00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,009
That's not my fault.

00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,319
What do you want, Sven?

00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,639
"Give me a snack."

00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,319
What's the magic word?

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,399
"Please."

00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,489
Uh! Uh-uh-uh. Share.

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,039
I can't believe they're finally opening up the gates!

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,881
And for a whole day! Faster, Percy!

00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,207
Arendelle, our most mysterious trade partner.

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,041
Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches.

00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,926
Did I say that out loud?

00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,519
Oh! Me sore eyes can't wait to see the queen and the princess.

00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,679
I bet they are absolutely lovely.

00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,882
I bet they are beautiful.

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,519
Princess Anna?

00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,802
Huh? Yeah?

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,879
Sorry to wake you, ma'am.

00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,719
No, no, no, you didn't.

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,490
I've been up for hours.

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,166
Who is it?

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,879
Still me, ma'am.

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,759
The gates will open soon. Time to get ready.

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,839
Of course.

00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,079
Ready for what?

00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,639
Your sister's coronation, ma'am.

00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,161
My sister's corneration.

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,919
It's Coronation Day!

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,163
It's Coronation Day!

00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,399
The window is open!

00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,559
So's that door!

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,879
I didn't know they did that any more

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,130
Who knew we owned 8,000 salad plates?

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,962
For years I've roamed these empty halls

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,562
Why have a ballroom with no balls?

00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,965
Finally, they're opening up the gates!

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,799
There'll be actual, real, live people

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,799
It'll be totally strange

00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,050
But wow! Am I so ready for this change!

00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,649
'Cause for the first time in forever

00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,359
There'll be music, there'll be light

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,802
For the first time in forever

00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,848
I'll be dancing through the night

00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,999
Don't know if I'm elated or gassy

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,965
But I'm somewhere in that zone

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,002
'Cause for the first time in forever

00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,799
I won't be alone

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,810
I can't wait to meet everyone!

00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,139
What if I meet The One?

00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,319
Tonight, imagine me gown and all

00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,639
Fetchingly draped against the wall

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,164
The picture of sophisticated grace

00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,639
I suddenly see him standing there

00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,959
A beautiful stranger, tall and fair

00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,639
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face!

00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,359
But then we laugh and talk all evening

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,639
Which is totally bizarre

00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,845
Nothing like the life I've led so far

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,205
For the first time in forever

00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,883
There'll be magic, there'll be fun

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,364
For the first time in forever

00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,083
I could be noticed by someone

00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,767
And I know it is totally crazy

00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,401
To dream I'd find romance

00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,409
But for the first time in forever

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,487
At least I've got a chance!

00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,969
{\an8}Don't let them in

00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,402
{\an8}Don't let them see

00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,930
{\an8}Be the good girl you always have to be

00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,251
{\an8}Conceal, don't feel

00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,443
{\an8}Put on a show

00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,891
{\an8}Make one wrong move and everyone will know

00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,719
{\an8}But it's only for today

00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,249
It's only for today

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,685
{\an8}It's agony to wait

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,685
It's agony to wait

00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,691
{\an8}Tell the guards to open up

00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,928
{\an8}The gate

00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,928
The gate

00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,599
For the first time in forever

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,409
{\an8}Don't let them in, don't let them see

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,439
I'm getting what I'm dreaming of

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,079
{\an8}Be the good girl you always have to be

00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,399
A chance to change my lonely world

00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,399
{\an8}Conceal

00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,799
A chance to find true love

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,959
{\an8}Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,959
I know it all ends tomorrow

00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,970
So it has to be today!

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,968
'Cause for the first time in forever

00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:56,362
For the first time in forever

00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,325
Nothing's in my way!

00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,119
Hey!

00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,651
I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,959
Hey.

00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,959
Uh... No, no, I'm okay.

00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,159
Are you sure?

00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,919
Yeah. I just wasn't looking where I was going.

00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,202
But I'm great, actually.

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,489
Oh... Thank goodness.

00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,399
Oh! Uh...

00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,329
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,649
Princess Anna of Arendelle.

00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,119
"Princess"? My Lady.

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,526
Oh!

00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,279
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa...

00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,845
Um... Whew.

00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,279
Hi. Again.

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,209
Oh, boy!

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,039
This is awkward.

00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,719
Not "You're awkward", but just because we're...

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,241
I'm awkward, you're gorgeous. Wait, what?

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,519
I'd like to formally apologize

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,927
for hitting the princess of Arendelle with my horse.

00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,199
And for every moment after.

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,799
No! No, no. It's fine.

00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,119
I'm not that princess.

00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,879
I mean, if you had hit my sister Elsa,

00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,719
it would be... Yeesh!

00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,279
Because, you know...

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,679
Hello.

00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,484
But, lucky you,

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,444
It's just me.

00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,087
"Just" you?

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,245
The bells. The coronation.

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,359
I better go.

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,131
I have to go. I better go. Uh...

00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,801
Bye!

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,324
Oh, no. Oh!

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,802
Your Majesty, the gloves.

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,604
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,122
Queen Elsa of Arendelle!

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,771
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,325
Princess Anna of Arendelle.

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,679
Oh. Here? Are you sure?

00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,879
Because I don't think I'm supposed to...

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,320
Oh. Okay.

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,447
Hi.

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,444
"Hi" me? Oh...

00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,330
Um... Hi.

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,359
You look beautiful.

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,479
Thank you. You look beautiful-ler.

00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,039
I mean, not "fuller." You don't look fuller.

00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,159
But more beautiful.

00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,169
Thank you.

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,526
So...

00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,609
This is what a party looks like.

00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,399
It's warmer than I thought.

00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,679
What is that amazing smell?

00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,726
Chocolate.

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,920
Your Majesty.

00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,045
The Duke of Weaseltown.

00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,044
"Weselton"! Duke of Weselton, Your Majesty.

00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,679
As your closest partner in trade it seems only fitting

00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,650
that I offer you your first dance as queen.

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,365
One-two, and jump.

00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,881
Uh...

00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,919
Thank you. Only, I don't dance.

00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,199
Oh...

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,239
But my sister does.

00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,599
What? - Oh! Lucky you.

00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,719
Oh, I don't think...

00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,127
If you swoon, let me know. I'll catch you.

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:34,839
Sorry.

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,719
Like an agile peacock.

00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,639
Ow! Ow.

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,719
Speaking of, so great to have the gates open.

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,922
Why did they shut them in the first place?

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,719
Do you know the reason? Hmm?

00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,559
No.

00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,091
All right. Hang on!

00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,919
They don't call me the "Little Dipper" for nothing!

00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,079
Oh-ho!

00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,727
Like a chicken with the face of a monkey, I fly.

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,719
Let me know when you're ready

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,919
for another round, Milady.

00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,851
Well, he was sprightly.

00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,079
Especially for a man in heels.

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,850
Are you okay?

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,649
I've never been better. This is so nice.

00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,122
I wish it could be like this all the time.

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,960
Me, too.

00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,679
But it can't.

00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,882
Why not? - It just can't.

00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,770
Excuse me for a minute.

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,249
I'd be honored.

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,881
Glad I caught you.

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,326
Hans.

00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,679
I often had a whole parlor to myself to slide!

00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,719
Oops!

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,119
Sorry.

00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,519
Your physique helps, I'm sure, too.

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,006
Ah.

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,479
What's this?

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,959
Uh, I was born with it.

00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,367
Although, I dreamed I was kissed by a troll.

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,799
I like it.

00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,479
Yeah, the whole thing.

00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,761
You got it.

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,766
Okay, wait, wait. So, you have how many brothers?

00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,889
Twelve older brothers.

00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,519
Three of them pretended I was invisible, literally, for two years.

00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,846
That's horrible.

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,486
It's what brothers do.

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,211
And sisters.

00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,719
Elsa and I were really close when we were little.

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,199
But then, one day, she just shut me out,

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,721
and I never knew why.

00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,199
I would never shut you out.

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,161
Okay, can I just say something crazy?

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,766
{\an8}I love crazy.

00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,649
All my life has been a series of doors in my face

00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,599
And then suddenly I bump into you

00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,959
{\an8}I was thinking the same thing, because, like...

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,209
{\an8}I've been searching my whole life to find my own place

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,959
{\an8}And maybe it's the party talking, or the chocolate fondue

00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,079
But with you

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,719
{\an8}But with you I found my place

00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,039
I see your face

00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,039
And it's nothing like I've ever known before

00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,409
Love is an open door!

00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,039
Love is an open door!

00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,719
Love is an open door

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,479
With you

00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,445
Love is an open door

00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,159
{\an8}I mean, it's crazy

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,459
What?

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,522
{\an8}We finish each other's

00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,022
Sandwiches

00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,759
{\an8}That's what I was gonna say!

00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,959
I've never met someone

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,079
Who thinks so much like me

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,559
Jinx! Jinx again!

00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,259
Our mental synchronization

00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,209
Can have but one explanation

00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,450
You and I were just meant to be

00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,959
Say goodbye

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,004
To the pain of the past

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,649
We don't have to feel it anymore

00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,846
Love is an open door

00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,199
Love is an open door!

00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,319
Life can be so much more

00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,319
With you

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,679
Love is an open

00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,362
Door

00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,649
{\an8}Can I say something crazy?

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,644
{\an8}Will you marry me?

00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,844
Can I say something even crazier?

00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,401
Yes!

00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,769
Coming through. Excuse me. Oh...

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,559
Pardon. Sorry. Oh!

00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,285
Can we just get around you there?

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,444
Thank you. Oh! There she is.

00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,639
Elsa!

00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,479
I mean, Queen. Me again. Um...

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,287
May I present Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,170
Your Majesty.

00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,759
We would like...

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,879
Uh, your blessing...

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,004
Of our marriage.

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,284
Marriage? - Yes!

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,839
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,159
Well, we haven't worked out all the details ourselves.

00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,079
We'll need a few days to plan the ceremony.

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,399
Of course, we'll have soup, roast, and ice cream. And then...

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,761
Wait. Would we live here?

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,999
Here? - Absolutely!

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,079
Anna!

00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,679
Oh! We can invite all twelve of your brothers to stay with us.

00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,959
What? No, no, no.

00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,288
Of course we have the room......

00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,319
Wait, slow down. No one's brothers are staying here.

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,885
No one is getting married.

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,519
Wait, what?

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,564
May I talk to you, please? Alone.

00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,801
No. Whatever you have to say, you can say to both of us.

00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,206
Fine. You can't marry a man you just met.

00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,239
You can if it's true love.

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,239
Anna, what do you know about true love?

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,359
More than you.

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,199
All you know is how to shut people out.

00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,171
You asked for my blessing, but my answer is no.

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,799
Now, excuse me.

00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,439
Your Majesty, if I may ease your...

00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,722
No, you may not. And I think you should go.

00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,839
The party is over. Close the gates.

00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,919
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,599
Elsa, no, no! Wait.

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,801
Give me my glove!

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,719
Elsa, please, please.

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,604
I can't live like this anymore!

00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,527
Then leave.

00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,719
What did I ever do to you?

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,919
Enough, Anna.

00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,168
No, why? Why do you shut me out?

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,885
Why do you shut the world out?

00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,724
What are you so afraid of?

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,690
I said, enough!

00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,206
Sorcery.

00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,286
I knew there was something dubious going on here.

00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,246
Elsa.

00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,441
There she is!

00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,359
Yes! It is her!

00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,686
Queen Elsa.

00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,450
Our beautiful queen!

00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,928
Your Majesty? Are you all right?

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,281
No.

00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,246
There she is! Stop her!

00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,479
Please, just stay away from me. Stay away.

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,962
Monster. Monster!

00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,006
Elsa!

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,924
Elsa!

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,280
Wait, please!

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,639
Elsa, stop!

00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,999
Anna!

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,201
No.

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,166
The fjord.

00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,924
Snow! Snow?

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,199
Yes, snow.

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,119
Are you all right? - No.

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,765
Did you know?

00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,487
No.

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,839
Look, it's snowing. It's snowing!

00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,559
The queen has cursed this land!

00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,799
She must be stopped! You have to go after her.

00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,199
Wait, no!

00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,719
You! Is there sorcery in you, too?

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,359
Are you a monster, too?

00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,359
No, no. I'm completely ordinary.

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,050
That's right, she is.

00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,524
In the best way.

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,159
And my sister is not a monster.

00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,799
She nearly killed me!

00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,399
You slipped on ice. - Her ice.

00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,841
It was an accident. She was scared.

00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,891
She didn't mean it. She didn't mean any of this.

00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,639
Tonight was my fault. I pushed her.

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,839
So, I'm the one

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,319
that needs to go after her.

00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,619
Bring me my horse, please.

00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,126
Anna, no. It's too dangerous.

00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,130
Elsa's not dangerous.

00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,279
I'll bring her back, and I'll make this right.

00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,359
I'm coming with you.

00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,769
No, I need you here to take care of Arendelle.

00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,765
On my honor.

00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,445
I leave Prince Hans in charge.

00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,125
Are you sure you can trust her?

00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,171
I don't want you getting hurt.

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,801
She's my sister.

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,731
She would never hurt me.

00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,980
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,

00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,980
not a footprint to be seen

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,480
A kingdom of isolation,

00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,980
and it looks like I'm the queen

00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:43,980
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,980
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried

00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,980
Don't let them in, don't let them see

00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,480
Be the good girl you always had to be

00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,980
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know

00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,980
Well, now they know!

00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,980
Let it go, let it go!

00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,980
Can't hold it back any more!

00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,480
Let it go, let it go!

00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,980
Turn away and slam the door!

00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,480
I don't care what they're going to say

00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,980
Let the storm rage on

00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,980
The cold never bothered me anyway.

00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,480
It's funny how some distance

00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,980
Makes everything seem small

00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,980
And the fears that once controlled me

00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,980
Can't get to me at all!

00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,980
It's time to see what I can do

00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,480
To test the limits and break through

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,480
No right, no wrong, no rules for me

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,480
I'm free!

00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,480
Let it go, let it go!

00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,480
I am one with the wind and sky

00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,980
Let it go, let it go!

00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,980
You'll never see me cry

00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:31,480
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,

00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,980
Let the storm rage on...

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,980
My power flurries through the air and to the ground

00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,980
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,980
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,480
I'm never going back

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,480
The past is in the past!

00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,480
Let it go, let it go!

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,480
And I'll rise like the break of dawn

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,980
Let it go, let it go!

00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:25,480
That perfect girl is gone

00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:34,480
Here I stand in the light of day

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,980
Let the storm rage on!

00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,480
The cold never bothered me anyway.

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,651
Elsa!

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,200
Elsa!

00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,604
Elsa, it's me, Anna,

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,850
your sister who didn't mean to make you freeze the summer.

00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,169
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,079
Of course, none of it would have happened

00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,044
if she had just told me her secret.

00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,211
She's a stinker.

00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,405
Whoa!

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,846
Oh, no. No, no, no! Come back!

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,411
No, no, no!

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,651
Okay.

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,368
Snow. It had to be snow.

00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,439
She couldn't have had tropical magic

00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,008
that covered the fjords in white sand and warm...

00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,279
Fire!

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,730
Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold.

00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,500
"Wandering Oaken's Trading Post".

00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,724
Ooh. "And sauna"!

00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,611
Hoo-hoo.

00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,166
Big summer blowout.

00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,599
Half off swimming suits, clogs,

00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,406
and a sun balm of my own invention, yah?

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,002
Oh. Great. For now, um, how about boots?

00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,324
Winter boots? And dresses?

00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,769
That would be in our winter department.

00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,131
Oh. Um...

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,799
I was just wondering.

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,048
Has another young woman...

00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,719
The queen perhaps, I don't know,

00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,959
passed through here?

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,439
Only one crazy enough to be out in this storm

00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,449
is you, dear.

00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,479
You and this fellow.

00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,519
Hoo-hoo.

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,846
Big summer blowout.

00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,999
Carrots.

00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,326
Huh?

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,251
Behind you.

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,569
Oh! Right. Excuse me.

00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,842
Oh. A real howler in July, yes?

00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,404
Wherever could it be coming from?

00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,611
The North Mountain.

00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,520
North Mountain.

00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,119
That will be forty.

00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,879
Forty? No, ten.

00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,127
Oh, dear, that's no good.

00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,159
See, this is from our winter stock,

00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,159
where supply and demand have a big problem.

00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,362
You want to talk about a supply and demand problem?

00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,727
I sell ice for a living.

00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,999
Ooh. That's a rough business to be in right now.

00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,359
I mean, that is really...

00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,721
That's unfortunate.

00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,999
Still forty.

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,248
But I will throw in a visit to Oaken's sauna.

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,409
Hoo-hoo. Hi, family.

00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,086
Hoo-hoo!

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,841
Ten's all I got. Help me out.

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,801
Okay. Ten will get you this and no more.

00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,079
Okay, just tell me one thing.

00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,039
What was happening on the North Mountain?

00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,959
Did it seem magical?

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,650
Yes!

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,085
Now, back up while I deal with this crook, here.

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,651
What did you call me?

00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,410
Okay, okay. I'm out.

00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,799
Whoa!

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,286
Bye-bye.

00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,441
No, Sven, I didn't get your carrots.

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,364
But I did find us a place to sleep.

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,570
And it's free.

00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,491
I'm sorry about this violence.

00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,250
I will add a quart of lutefisk,

00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,091
so we have good feelings.

00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,930
Just the outfit and the boots, yah?

00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,361
Uh...

00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,884
Reindeers are better than people

00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,843
Sven, don't you think that's true?

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,239
"Yeah, people will beat you and curse you and cheat you"

00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,841
"Every one of them's bad, except you!"

00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,804
Aw. Thanks, buddy.

00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,449
But people smell better than reindeers

00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,765
Sven, don't you think I'm right?

00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,167
"That's once again true, for all except you!"

00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,479
You got me! Let's call it a night.

00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,409
"Good night"

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,125
Don't let the frostbite

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,601
Bite

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,845
Nice duet.

00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,926
It's just you. What do you want?

00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,562
I want you to take me up the North Mountain.

00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,490
I don't take people places.

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,759
Let me rephrase that.

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,405
Hey.

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,486
Take me up the North Mountain.

00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,164
Please.

00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,362
Look, I know how to stop this winter.

00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,330
We leave at dawn.

00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,922
And you forgot the carrots for Sven.

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,999
Oops, sorry.

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,487
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't...

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,207
We leave now. Right now.

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,486
Whew!

00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,399
Hang on! We like to go fast.

00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,919
I like fast. - Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa...

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,639
Get your feet down. This is fresh lacquer.

00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,239
Seriously, were you raised in a barn?

00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,679
Ugh!

00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,486
No, I was raised in a castle.

00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,405
So, uh, tell me,

00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,643
what made the queen go all ice-crazy?

00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,881
Oh. Well...

00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,640
It was all my fault.

00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,119
I got engaged, but then she freaked out,

00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,971
because I'd only just met him you know, that day.

00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,879
And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage, and...

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,439
Wait. You got engaged to someone you just met that day?

00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,759
Yeah. Anyway, I got mad, and so she got mad,

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,879
and then she tried to walk away, and I grabbed her glove...

00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,039
Hang on!

00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,999
You mean to tell me you got engaged

00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,679
to someone you just met that day?

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,120
Yes. Pay attention.

00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,199
But the thing is, she wore the gloves all the time,

00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,639
so I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt.

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,684
Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,169
Yyyyyes, they did.

00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,961
But Hans is not a stranger.

00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,959
Oh, yeah? What's his last name?

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,559
"Of the Southern Isles."

00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,999
What's his favorite food? - Sandwiches.

00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,399
Best friend's name? - Probably John.

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,519
Eye color? - Dreamy.

00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,079
Foot size? - Foot size doesn't matter.

00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,919
Have you had a meal with him yet? What if you hate the way he eats?

00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,531
What if you hate the way he picks his nose?

00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,801
Picks his nose?

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,999
And eats it.

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,601
Excuse me, sir. He is a prince.

00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,125
All men do it.

00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,559
Look, it doesn't matter. It's true love.

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,220
It doesn't sound like true love.

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,526
Are you some sort of love expert?

00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,806
No. But, uh, I have friends who are.

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,239
You have friends

00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,639
who are love experts? I'm not buying it.

00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,319
Stop talking. - No, no, no. No, no.

00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,090
I'd like to meet these... - No, I mean it.

00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,159
Sven, go.

00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,407
Go!

00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,479
What are they? - Wolves.

00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,727
Wolves?

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,479
What do we do? - I got this.

00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,759
You just... Don't fall off, and don't get eaten.

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,799
But I want to help!

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,919
No. - Why not?

00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,999
Because I don't trust your judgment.

00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,279
Excuse me?

00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,119
Who marries a man she just met?

00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,439
It's true love!

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,679
Whoa!

00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,291
Whoa. Whoa!

00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,885
Christopher!

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,319
It's "Kristoff"!

00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,851
Ow!

00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,119
Duck!

00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,759
You almost set me on fire!

00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,961
But I didn't.

00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,759
Get ready to jump, Sven!

00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,279
You don't tell him what to do.

00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,845
I do!

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,879
Jump, Sven!

00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,121
Phew!

00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,886
But I just paid it off.

00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,044
Uh-oh. No. No.

00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,519
No!

00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,399
Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,681
Grab on!

00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,199
Pull, Sven. Pull!

00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,239
Whoa.

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,688
I'll replace your sled, and everything in it.

00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,281
And I understand if you don't want to help me anymore.

00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,446
Of course I don't want to help her anymore. In fact,

00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,039
this whole thing has ruined me for helping anyone ever again.

00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,079
It's this way?

00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,199
"She'll die on her own."

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,084
I can live with that. - Here we go.

00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,319
"But you won't get your new sled if she's dead."

00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,931
I think, actually, it's up.

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,399
Sometimes, I really don't like you.

00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,921
Hold up! We're coming.

00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,399
You are?

00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,559
I mean, sure. I'll let you tag along.

00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,205
Arendelle.

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,928
It's completely frozen.

00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,079
But it will be fine. Elsa will thaw it.

00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,439
Will she?

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,119
Yeah. Now, come on.

00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,959
This way to the North Mountain?

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,599
More like this way.

00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,162
I never knew winter could be so beautiful.

00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,559
Yeah.

00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,683
It really is beautiful, isn't it?

00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,361
But it's so white.

00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,610
You know, how about a little color?

00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,999
I'm thinking maybe some crimson, chartreuse.

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,645
How about yellow?

00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,963
No, not yellow. Yellow and snow?

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,479
No go.

00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,930
Am I right?

00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,239
You're creepy.

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,639
I don't want it.

00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,079
Back at you. - Please don't drop me.

00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,359
Come on, it's just a head.

00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,679
All right. We got off to a bad start.

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,086
Ew, ew, ew, the body!

00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,799
Wait, what am I looking at right now?

00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,519
Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat?

00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,999
All right, wait one second.

00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,531
Oh. Uh...

00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,759
Oh!

00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,325
Thank you. - You're welcome.

00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,399
Now, I'm perfect.

00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,086
Well, almost.

00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,159
It was like my whole life got turned upside down.

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,441
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry!

00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,359
Head rush! - I was just... Are you okay?

00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,879
Are you kidding me? I am wonderful!

00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,730
I've always wanted a nose.

00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,119
So cute.

00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,879
It's like a little baby unicorn.

00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,999
But... Hey! Whoa!

00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,039
Oh.

00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,049
I love it even more.

00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,085
All right, let's start this thing over.

00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,239
Hi, everyone.

00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,319
I'm Olaf.

00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,726
And I like warm hugs.

00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,281
Olaf?

00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,409
That's right. Olaf.

00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,608
And you are?

00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,081
Oh. Um...

00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,239
I'm Anna.

00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,679
And who's the funky-looking donkey over there?

00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,239
That's Sven.

00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,199
And who's the reindeer?

00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,239
Sven.

00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,079
Oh, they're... Oh. Okay. That makes things easier for me.

00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,760
Aw, look at him trying to kiss my nose.

00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,883
I like you, too.

00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,522
Olaf. Did Elsa build you? - Yeah. Why?

00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,759
Do you know where she is? - Yeah. Why?

00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,919
Fascinating.

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,681
Do you think you could show us the way? - Yeah. Why?

00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,119
How does this work? Ow!

00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,359
Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus, here.

00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,562
Yeah. Why? - I'll tell you why.

00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,645
We need Elsa to bring back summer.

00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,519
Summer?

00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,839
Oh. I don't know why,

00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,599
but I've always loved the idea of summer

00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,199
and sun, and all things hot.

00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,279
Really?

00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,839
I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.

00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,121
Nope.

00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,759
But sometimes I like to close my eyes,

00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,806
and imagine what it would be like when summer does come.

00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,119
Bees will buzz, kids will blow dandelion fuzz

00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:55,087
And I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer

00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,839
A drink in my hand

00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,239
My snow up against the burning sand

00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,519
Probably getting gorgeously tanned

00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,290
In summer.

00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,879
I'll finally see a summer breeze

00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,999
Blow away a winter storm

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,279
And find out what happens to solid water

00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,211
When it gets warm

00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,999
And I can't wait to see

00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,043
What my buddies all think of me

00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,799
Just imagine how much cooler I'll be

00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,207
In summer!

00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,679
The hot and the cold are both so intense

00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,247
Put them together It just makes sense

00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,679
Winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle

00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,223
But put me in summer and I'll be a...

00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,520
{\an8}(puddle?)

00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,599
Happy snowman!

00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,879
When life gets rough

00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,401
I like to hold on to my dream

00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,407
Of relaxing in the summer sun, just letting off steam

00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,285
Oh, the sky will be blue

00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,724
And you guys will be there, too

00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,679
When I finally do

00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,168
What frozen things do in summer!

00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,884
I'm gonna tell him.

00:49:10,885 --> 00:49:11,884
Don't you dare.

00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,687
In summer!

00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,559
So, come on! Elsa's this way.

00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,759
Let's go bring back summer!

00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,200
I'm coming!

00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,525
Somebody's gotta tell him.

00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,039
No, no. You've got the bark facing down.

00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,765
The bark needs to be face-up.

00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,239
Bark down is drier. - Bark up!

00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,279
Bark down! - Papa!

00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,999
Cloak? Does anyone need a cloak?

00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,199
Arendelle is indebted to you, Your Highness.

00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,559
The castle is open.

00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,730
There is soup and hot gløgg in the Great Hall.

00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,919
Here, pass these out.

00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,479
Prince Hans!

00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,999
Are we expected to just sit here and freeze

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,646
while you give away all of Arendelle's tradable goods?

00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,399
Princess Anna has given her orders.

00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,199
And that's another thing!

00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,799
Has it dawned on you that your princess may be conspiring

00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,119
with a wicked sorceress

00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,199
to destroy us all?

00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,970
Do not question the princess.

00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,479
She left me in charge

00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,799
and I will not hesitate

00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,525
to protect Arendelle from treason.

00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,279
Treason?

00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,719
Whoa! Whoa!

00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,519
Whoa, boy. Easy.

00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,801
Easy.

00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,120
It's Princess Anna's horse.

00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,925
So, where is the princess?

00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,120
Where could she be? - Where is she?

00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,805
Princess Anna is in trouble.

00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,159
I need volunteers to go with me to find her.

00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,399
I'll go. I volunteer.

00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,568
I volunteer two men, My Lord.

00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,491
Be prepared for anything.

00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,842
And should you encounter the queen,

00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,966
you are to put an end to this winter.

00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,091
Do you understand?

00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,205
So, how exactly are you planning to stop this weather?

00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,081
Oh. I am gonna talk to my sister.

00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,479
That's your plan?

00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,359
My ice business is riding on you talking to your sister?

00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,766
Yep.

00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,885
So, you're not at all afraid of her?

00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,090
Why would I be?

00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:14,643
Yeah. I bet she's the nicest, gentlest, warmest person ever.

00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,799
Oh. Look at that.

00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,207
I've been impaled.

00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,527
What now?

00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,009
Mmm...

00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,799
It's too steep.

00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,319
I've only got one rope and you don't know how to climb mountains.

00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,679
Says who?

00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,120
Hmm?

00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,561
What are you doing?

00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,646
I'm going to see my sister.

00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,241
You're gonna kill yourself.

00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,839
I wouldn't put my foot there.

00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,690
You're distracting me. - Or there.

00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,639
How do you know Elsa even wants to see you?

00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,399
All right. I'm just blocking you out

00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,251
because I gotta concentrate, here.

00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,919
You know, most people who disappear

00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,451
into the mountains want to be alone.

00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,882
Nobody wants to be alone.

00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,399
Except maybe you.

00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,649
I'm not alone. I have friends, remember?

00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,364
You mean, the love experts?

00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,563
Yes, the love experts.

00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,764
Ah...

00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,090
Please tell me I'm almost there.

00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,519
Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here?

00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,119
Hang on.

00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,321
Hey, Sven?

00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,239
Not sure if this is gonna solve the problem,

00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,279
but I found a staircase that leads exactly

00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,479
where you wanted to go.

00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,599
Ha-ha! Thank goodness. Catch!

00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,886
Thanks. That was like a crazy trust exercise.

00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,759
Whoa.

00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,803
Now, that's ice.

00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,799
I might cry.

00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,571
Go ahead. I won't judge.

00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,759
All right, take it easy, boy. Come here.

00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,485
I got you.

00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,327
Okay. You stay right here, buddy.

00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,606
Flawless.

00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,881
Knock.

00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,211
Just knock.

00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,770
Why isn't she knocking?

00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,165
Do you think she knows how to knock?

00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,959
Huh. It opened.

00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,446
That's a first.

00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,519
Oh. You should probably wait out here.

00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,639
What? - The last time I introduced her to a guy,

00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,999
she froze everything.

00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,919
But, but... Oh, come on!

00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,885
It's a palace made of ice. Ice is my life!

00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,999
Bye, Sven.

00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,770
You, too, Olaf.

00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,929
Me? - Just give us a minute.

00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,526
Okay.

00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,290
One, two, three...

00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,724
Four...

00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,281
Whoa.

00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,561
Elsa?

00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,443
It's me, Anna.

00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,965
Anna.

00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,162
Whoa. Elsa, you look different.

00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,290
It's a good different.

00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,926
And this place...

00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,566
It's amazing.

00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,881
Thank you.

00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,282
I never knew what I was capable of.

00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,479
I'm so sorry about what happened. If I'd have known...

00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,806
No, no, no. It's okay.

00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,090
You don't have to apologize, but you should probably go.

00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,879
Please.

00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,241
But I just got here.

00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,564
You belong down in Arendelle.

00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,879
So do you.

00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,208
No, Anna, I belong here.

00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,401
Alone.

00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,850
Where I can be who I am without hurting anybody.

00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,083
Actually, about that...

00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,370
Sixty! - Wait. What is that?

00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,526
Hi! I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs!

00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,367
Olaf?

00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,281
You built me.

00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,041
Remember that?

00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,647
And you're alive?

00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,602
Um... I think so.

00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,686
He's just like the one we built as kids.

00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,046
Yeah.

00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,449
Elsa, we were so close.

00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,524
We can be like that again.

00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,480
Catch me! Slow down!

00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,161
Anna!

00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,759
No.

00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,440
We can't. Goodbye, Anna.

00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,559
Elsa, wait.

00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,759
No, I'm just trying to protect you.

00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,611
You don't have to protect me. I'm not afraid.

00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,283
Please don't shut me out again.

00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,519
Please don't slam the door

00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,599
You don't have to keep your distance anymore

00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,610
'Cause for the first time in forever

00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,799
I finally understand

00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,159
For the first time in forever

00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,439
We can fix this hand in hand

00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,608
We can head down this mountain together.

00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,639
You don't have to live in fear

00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,561
'Cause for the first time in forever

00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,919
I will be right here

00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,199
{\an8}Anna.

00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,119
{\an8}Please go back home

00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,890
{\an8}Your life awaits

00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,239
{\an8}Go enjoy the sun, and open up the gates

00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,350
Yeah, but...

00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:27,719
{\an8}I know.

00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:32,050
{\an8}You mean well, but leave me be

00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,559
{\an8}Yes, I'm alone

00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,519
{\an8}But I'm alone and free

00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:41,282
{\an8}Just stay away and you'll be safe from me

00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,521
Actually, we're not

00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,950
{\an8}What do you mean, you're not?

00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,450
I get the feeling you don't know

00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,681
{\an8}What do I not know?

00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,399
Arendelle's in deep, deep, deep

00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,682
deep snow

00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,041
{\an8}What?

00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,002
You kind of set off an eternal winter everywhere.

00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,359
{\an8}Everywhere?

00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,279
Well, it's okay, you can just unfreeze it.

00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,528
{\an8}No, I can't. I don't know how.

00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,081
Sure you can. I know you can.

00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:12,401
'Cause for the first time in forever

00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:15,519
{\an8}Oh, I'm such a fool! I can't be free!

00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:17,950
You don't have to be afraid

00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,839
{\an8}No escape from the storm inside of me

00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,839
We can work this out together

00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,819
{\an8}I can't control the curse!

00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,639
We'll reverse the storm you've made

00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,219
{\an8}Anna, please you'll only make it worse!

00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,019
Don't panic!

00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,319
{\an8}There's so much fear!

00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,919
We'll make the sun shine bright

00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,319
{\an8}You're not safe here!

00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,119
We can face this thing together

00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,119
{\an8}No!

00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,279
We can change this winter weather

00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,768
And everything will be all right

00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,761
{\an8}I can't!

00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,441
Anna!

00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,201
Are you okay?

00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,479
I'm okay.

00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,920
I'm fine.

00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,159
Who's this?

00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,771
Wait, it doesn't matter. Just...

00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,199
You have to go.

00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,999
No, I know we can figure this out together.

00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,079
How?

00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,442
What power do you have to stop this winter?

00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,046
To stop me?

00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,559
Anna, I think we should go.

00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,559
No, I'm not leaving without you, Elsa.

00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,444
Yes, you are.

00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,799
Stop! Put us down!

00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,604
Go away.

00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,565
Heads up!

00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,439
Watch out for my butt!

00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,959
It is not nice to throw people!

00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,199
Whoa, whoa, whoa, feisty-pants. Okay, relax.

00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,599
Just calm down! Calm down! - Okay! All right!

00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,279
I'm okay. - Just let the snowman be.

00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,599
I'm calm.

00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,325
Oh! Come on!

00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,839
Oh. Look, see? Now you made him mad.

00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,804
I'll distract him. You guys go.

00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,331
No, no! Not you guys!

00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,480
This just got a whole lot harder.

00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,321
Look out!

00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,763
What are you doing?

00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,441
I got him!

00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,159
Whoa! Stop!

00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,407
It's a hundred-foot drop.

00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,007
It's two hundred.

00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,521
Ow!

00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,199
What's that for? - I'm digging a snow anchor.

00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,890
Okay. What if we fall?

00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,119
There's 20 feet of fresh powder down there.

00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,879
It'll be like landing on a pillow.

00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,959
Hopefully.

00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,199
Okay, Anna. On three.

00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,559
One...

00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,639
Okay. You tell me when. I'm ready to go.

00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,279
Two... - I was born ready! Yes!

00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,561
Calm down.

00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,679
Tree!

00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,961
What the... Whoa!

00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,604
That happened.

01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,519
Man, am I out of shape.

01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,519
There we go. Hey, Anna!

01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,359
Sven! Where did you guys go?

01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,211
We totally lost Marshmallow back there.

01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,039
Hey! We were just talking about you.

01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,208
All good things, all good things.

01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,721
No!

01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,199
This is not making much of a difference, is it?

01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,799
Olaf!

01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,764
Hang in there, guys!

01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,959
Go. Go faster!

01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,810
Wait, what?

01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,599
Ow!

01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,079
Kristoff!

01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,808
Don't come back!

01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,521
We won't.

01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,484
Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow.

01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,886
Olaf!

01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,999
I can't feel my legs! I can't feel my legs!

01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,559
Those are my legs.

01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,079
Oooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt.

01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,169
Oh. That feels better.

01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,921
Hey, Sven! He found us.

01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,159
Who's my cute little reindeer?

01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,279
Don't talk to him like that.

01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,164
You're tickling me.

01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,281
Here.

01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,599
Whoa!

01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,799
Are you okay?

01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,365
Thank you.

01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,526
How's your head? - Ah! Ooh!

01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,439
It's fine. Uh...

01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,119
Uh, I'm good. I've got a thick skull.

01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,129
I don't have a skull.

01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,921
Or bones.

01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,641
So, uh... So, now what?

01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,799
Now what?

01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,199
Now what?

01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,481
Oh...

01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,040
What am I gonna do?

01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,839
She threw me out.

01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,199
I can't go back to Arendelle with the weather like this.

01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,279
And then there's your ice business.

01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,006
Hey, hey. Don't worry about my ice business.

01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,259
Worry about your hair!

01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,639
What? I just fell off a cliff. You should see your hair.

01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,359
No, yours is turning white.

01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,279
White? It's... What?

01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,482
It's because she struck you, isn't it?

01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,690
Does it look bad?

01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,039
No. - You hesitated.

01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,287
No, I didn't.

01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,559
Anna, you need help, okay? Come on.

01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,250
Okay! Where are we going?

01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,359
To see my friends.

01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,679
The love experts?

01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,530
Love experts?

01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,159
And don't worry, they'll be able to fix this.

01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,010
How do you know?

01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,723
Because I've seen them do it before.

01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,159
I like to consider myself a love expert.

01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,570
Get it together.

01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,559
Control it.

01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,364
Don't feel. Don't feel.

01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,490
Don't feel.

01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,324
Don't feel!

01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,407
Look, Sven, the sky's awake.

01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,569
Are you cold? - A little.

01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,959
Uh... Wait. Come here.

01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,241
Huh?

01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,251
Ooh.

01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,919
So, uh, about my friends. Well...

01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,359
I say "friends"...

01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,399
They're more like family.

01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,399
Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven.

01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,489
Until they, you know, kinda took us in.

01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,365
They did?

01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,679
Yeah. I don't want to scare you.

01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:39,119
They can be a little inappropriate and loud.

01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,685
Very loud.

01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,679
They are also stubborn at times,

01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,959
and a little overbearing.

01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,759
And heavy. Really, really, heavy.

01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,119
But you'll get it. They mean well.

01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,448
Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,971
Okay, then.

01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,489
Meet my family.

01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,401
Hey, guys.

01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,450
They're rocks.

01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,799
You are a sight for sore eyes.

01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,731
He's crazy. - Hey look, Magma's back from vacation!

01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,488
Rocko's looking sharp, as usual.

01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,919
Clay, whoa... I don't even recognize you.

01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,039
You lost so much weight.

01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,999
I'll distract him while you run. - Didn't realize how much I missed you guys.

01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,123
Hi, Sven's family!

01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,801
It's nice to meet you.

01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,439
Because I love you, Anna, I insist you run. - Guys, I've got so much to tell you.

01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,531
I understand you're love experts. Ooh! - Stop kissing Crystal and find Grandpabbie!

01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,490
Why aren't you running?

01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,799
Uh...

01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,287
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go.

01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,444
No, no, no. Anna, wait.

01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,490
Kristoff!

01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,444
Whoa!

01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,166
Hey!

01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,559
Kristoff's home!

01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,839
Kristoff's here! Kristoff's home!

01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,319
Wait, "Kristoff"?

01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,799
Ah, let me look at you.

01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,479
Take off your clothes, I wash them.

01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,364
No! No, I'm going to keep my clothes on.

01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,799
Look, it's great to see you all,

01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,039
but where's Granpabbie?

01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,159
He's napping.

01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,959
But look, I grew a mushroom.

01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,559
I earned my fire crystal.

01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,000
I passed a kidney stone.

01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,319
Kristoff, pick me up.

01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,599
You're getting big.

01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,881
Good for you.

01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,568
Trolls. They're trolls!

01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,124
He's brought a girl!

01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,886
A girl!

01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,759
Is that a real girl?

01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,879
She's like a little cupcake.

01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,959
What's going on?

01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,286
I've learned to just roll with it.

01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,879
Let me see. Bright eyes, working nose,

01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,411
strong teeth!

01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,279
Yes, yes. She'll do nicely for our Kristoff.

01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,519
Wait, wait, wait. Oh, um, no.

01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,919
You've got the wrong idea.

01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,079
No. That's not why I brought her here.

01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,959
Right. We're not... I'm not...

01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,159
What's the issue, dear?

01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,319
Why are you holding back from such a man?

01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,329
Is it the clumpy way he walks?

01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,679
What? - Or the grumpy way he talks?

01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,479
Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped

01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,039
Weirdness of his feet?

01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,159
Hey!

01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,119
And though we know he washes well

01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,759
He always ends up sort of smelly

01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,399
But you'll never meet a fella

01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,359
Who's as sensitive and sweet

01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,479
That's nice, but...

01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,519
So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper

01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,599
So, he's got a few flaws

01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,839
Like his peculiar brain, dear

01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,999
His thing with the reindeer

01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,679
That's a little outside of nature's laws

01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,799
This is not about me!

01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,559
So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper

01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,759
But this we're certain of

01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,399
You can fix this fixer-upper up

01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,199
With a little bit of love

01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,239
Can we please just stop talking about this?

01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,479
We've got a real, actual problem, here.

01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,081
I'll say. So, tell me, dear...

01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,359
Is it the way that he runs scared?

01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,449
Or that he's socially impaired?

01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,879
Or that he only likes to tinkle in the woods?

01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,999
I did not need to know that.

01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,239
Are you holding back your fondness

01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,719
Due to his unmanly blondness?

01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:43,403
Or the way he covers up that he's the honest goods?

01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,519
He's just a bit of a fixer-upper

01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,039
He's got a couple of bugs

01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,919
(No, I don't!) - His isolation is confirmation

01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,919
Of his desperation for healing hugs

01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,479
So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper

01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,239
But we know what to do

01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,279
The way to fix up this fixer-upper

01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,839
Is to fix him up with you

01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,519
Whoa!

01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,165
Stop it, stop it, stop it! Enough!

01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:08,366
She is engaged to someone else, okay?

01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,079
So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper

01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,009
That's a minor thing

01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,479
Her quote "engagement" is a flex arrangement

01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,839
And by the way, I don't see no ring

01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,119
So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper

01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,322
Her brain's a bit betwixt

01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,799
Get the fiance out of the way

01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,121
And the whole thing will be fixed

01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,959
We're not saying you can change him

01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,049
'Cause people don't really change

01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,679
We're only saying that love's a force

01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,039
That's powerful and strange

01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,279
People make bad choices

01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,687
If they're mad or scared or stressed

01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,799
But throw a little love their way

01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,159
Throw a little love their way

01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,283
And you'll bring out their best

01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,688
True love brings out the best

01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,367
Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper

01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,319
That's what it's all about

01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,399
Father! Sister! Brother!

01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,199
We need each other to raise us up

01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,561
And round us out

01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,959
Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper

01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:11,479
But when push comes to shove

01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,759
The only fixer-upper fixer

01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,839
That can fix a fixer-upper is...

01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,279
True, true

01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,399
True

01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,479
Love!

01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,839
Love, love, love

01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,839
Love! True love

01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:23,999
True

01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,199
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be your trollfully wedded...

01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,159
Wait, what? - You're getting married.

01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,319
Love!

01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,601
Anna?

01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,806
She's as cold as ice.

01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,170
There is strange magic here.

01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,563
Granpabbie. - Come, come. Bring her here to me.

01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,725
Anna, your life is in danger.

01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,324
There is ice in your heart put there by your sister.

01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:55,648
If not removed, to solid ice will you freeze, forever.

01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,239
What? No.

01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,679
But you can remove it, right?

01:08:58,680 --> 01:08:59,879
I cannot

01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,889
I'm sorry, Kristoff.

01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,399
If it was her head, that would be easy.

01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:09,401
But only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart.

01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,679
An act of true love?

01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,167
A true love's kiss, perhaps?

01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,279
(Something's wrong. Are you all right?)

01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,879
Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans.

01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,999
Hans.

01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,201
Pull us out, Sven.

01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,359
Olaf, come on!

01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,085
I'm coming!

01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,363
Let's go kiss Hans!

01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,484
Who is this Hans?

01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,489
We are here to find Princess Anna.

01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:51,442
Be on guard, but no harm is to come to the queen.

01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,879
Do you understand?

01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,880
Yes, Your Grace.

01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,491
The queen.

01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,568
Go, go! Come on!

01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:29,887
There!

01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,567
Up there!

01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,325
Come on!

01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,081
We got her.

01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,920
No. Please.

01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,530
Go around. Toss it.

01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,886
Stay away!

01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,326
Look out!

01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,839
Fire! Fire!

01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,246
Get her!

01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,321
Ah!

01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,926
Come on!

01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,007
Grab his arm.

01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,441
Aim...

01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,239
This way, this way!

01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,441
Whoa!

01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,847
Queen Elsa!

01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,761
Don't be the monster they fear you are.

01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,927
Oh, no. What have... What have I done?

01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,491
Why did you bring me here?

01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,439
I couldn't just let them kill you.

01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,769
But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get Anna.

01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,199
Anna has not returned.

01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,048
If you would just stop the winter.

01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,846
Bring back summer, please.

01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,645
Don't you see?

01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,280
I can't.

01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:18,281
You have to tell them to let me go.

01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,889
I will do what I can.

01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,999
Just hang in there.

01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,361
Come on, buddy, faster!

01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,359
Oh, boy!

01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,562
Whoa! I'll meet you guys at the castle!

01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,999
Stay out of sight, Olaf.

01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,725
I will!

01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:04,161
Hello! - It's alive!

01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,725
It's Princess Anna!

01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,969
Are you gonna be okay?

01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,679
Don't worry about me.

01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,519
Anna!

01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,439
You had us worried sick. My Lady.

01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:35,439
Get her warm. And find Prince Hans, immediately.

01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,051
We will. Thank you.

01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,731
Make sure she's safe.

01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,679
Oh, you poor girl, you're freezing.

01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:44,089
Oh, let's get you inside now and get you warm.

01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,399
I'm going back out to look for Princess Anna.

01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,250
You cannot risk going out there again.

01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,599
If anything happens to her...

01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,564
If anything happens to the princess,

01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,127
you are all Arendelle has left.

01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,519
He's in here.

01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:11,639
Prince Hans.

01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,079
Anna.

01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,199
You're so cold.

01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,439
Hans, you have to kiss me. - What?

01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,159
Now! Now! - Slow down.

01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,089
We'll give you two some privacy.

01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,039
What happened out there?

01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,129
Elsa struck me with her powers.

01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,679
You said she'd never hurt you.

01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:25,759
I was wrong.

01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,325
Anna.

01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,690
She froze my heart,

01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,366
and only an act of true love can save me.

01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,804
A true love's kiss.

01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,160
Oh, Anna.

01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,559
If only there was someone out there who loved you.

01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,000
What?

01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,284
You said you did.

01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,199
As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom,

01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,479
I didn't stand a chance.

01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:09,239
I knew I would have to marry into the throne somewhere.

01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,805
What... What are you talking about?

01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,767
As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course.

01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,839
But no one was getting anywhere with her.

01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,919
But you...

01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,439
You were so desperate for love,

01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,371
you were willing to marry me just like that.

01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,639
I figured after we married,

01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,799
I would have to stage a little accident for Elsa.

01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,048
Hans! No. Stop.

01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,159
But then, she doomed herself,

01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,119
and you were dumb enough to go after her.

01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,239
Please.

01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,920
All that's left now is to kill Elsa,

01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,971
and bring back summer.

01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,439
You're no match for Elsa.

01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,847
No, you're no match for Elsa.

01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,681
I, on the other hand,

01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:50,729
am the hero who is going to save Arendelle from destruction.

01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,011
You won't get away with this.

01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,607
Oh...

01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,811
I already have.

01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,324
Please, somebody, help.

01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,123
Please. Please.

01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,999
It's getting colder by the minute.

01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,719
If we don't do something soon, we'll all freeze to death.

01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,331
Prince Hans.

01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,443
Princess Anna is...

01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,239
Dead.

01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,319
What?

01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,010
What happened to her?

01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,450
She was killed...

01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,079
... by Queen Elsa.

01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,327
No!

01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,681
Her own sister.

01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,967
At least we got to say our marriage vows

01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,282
before she died in my arms.

01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,730
There can be no doubt now.

01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,399
Queen Elsa is a monster,

01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,523
and we are all in grave danger.

01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,921
Prince Hans,

01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,483
Arendelle looks to you.

01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,719
With a heavy heart,

01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:03,891
I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason.

01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,968
And sentence her to death.

01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,481
Hurry up!

01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,639
She's dangerous.

01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,001
Move quickly. Careful!

01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,250
It won't open! It's frozen shut.

01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,686
Put your back into it!

01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,279
Come on! Push!

01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:56,559
What is it, buddy?

01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,205
Hey, watch it.

01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,761
What's wrong with you?

01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,282
I don't understand you when you talk like that.

01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,079
Stop it! Put me down!

01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,639
No, Sven!

01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,239
We're not going back.

01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:14,930
She's with her true love.

01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:22,921
What the...

01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:26,841
Anna!

01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,685
Come on! Come on, boy.

01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:53,881
Help.

01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,525
Anna!

01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,680
Oh, no.

01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,081
Olaf?

01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,482
Olaf. Get away from there.

01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,161
Wow!

01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,919
So, this is heat.

01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,439
I love it.

01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,210
Ooh! But don't touch it.

01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,444
So, where's Hans? What happened to your kiss?

01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,806
I was wrong about him. It wasn't true love.

01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,725
But we ran all the way here.

01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,239
Please, Olaf, you can't stay here. You'll melt.

01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,359
I am not leaving here until

01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:51,131
we find some other act of true love to save you.

01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,369
Do you happen to have any ideas?

01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,410
I don't even know what love is.

01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,484
That's okay, I do.

01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,285
Love is

01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,647
putting someone else's needs before yours.

01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:07,211
Like, you know, how Kristoff brought you back here to Hans and left you forever.

01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,529
Kristoff loves me?

01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,607
Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you?

01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,924
Olaf, you're melting.

01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,402
Some people are worth melting for.

01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,642
Just maybe not right this second.

01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,286
Don't worry, I've got it.

01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,923
We're gonna get through... Oh, wait.

01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,690
Hang on, I'm getting something.

01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,159
It's Kristoff and Sven!

01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:44,566
They're coming back this way.

01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,361
They... They are?

01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,160
Wow! He's really moving fast.

01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,639
I guess I was wrong.

01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,207
I guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind.

01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,839
Help me up, Olaf. Please.

01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,999
No, no, no! You need to stay by the fire and keep warm.

01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,759
I need to get to Kristoff.

01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,041
Why?

01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,959
Oh, I know why!

01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,159
There's your act of true love right there!

01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:11,159
Riding across the fjords like a valiant, pungent reindeer king!

01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,646
Come on!

01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,519
Look out!

01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,960
Oh!

01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,370
Uh... Back this way.

01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,250
We're trapped.

01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,880
Oh...

01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,410
Whoa!

01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,130
Slide, Anna!

01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,571
We made it!

01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,330
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,570
Come on, buddy, faster.

01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,411
Kristoff!

01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,645
Keep going!

01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,485
Kristoff!

01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,167
Come on!

01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,567
No.

01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:19,841
Whoa!

01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,050
Whoa!

01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,010
Sven!

01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,965
Good boy.

01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,771
Kristoff.

01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,609
Kristoff...

01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,601
Anna!

01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:08,369
Elsa! You can't run from this!

01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,639
Just take care of my sister.

01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,279
Your sister?

01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,926
She returned from the mountain weak and cold.

01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,239
She said that you froze her heart.

01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,399
No.

01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,648
I tried to save her, but it was too late.

01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,441
Her skin was ice. Her hair turned white.

01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,570
Your sister is dead.

01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,999
Because of you.

01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,247
No.

01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,521
Kristoff.

01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,450
Anna!

01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,405
Elsa?

01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,807
No!

01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,401
Anna!

01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,850
Oh. Anna!

01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,802
No, no!

01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,445
Please, no.

01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,201
Anna?

01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,210
Anna?

01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,880
Oh, Elsa.

01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,407
You sacrificed yourself for me?

01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,519
I love you.

01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:50,442
"An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart."

01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,690
"Love will thaw."

01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,439
Love. Of course.

01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,721
Elsa?

01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,441
Love!

01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,691
I knew you could do it.

01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:52,442
Hands down, this is the best day of my life.

01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,759
And, quite possibly, the last.

01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,281
Oh, Olaf! Hang on, little guy.

01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:59,250
Oh, Oh, Oh!

01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:04,443
My own personal flurry!

01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:10,770
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:14,841
Anna?

01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,844
But she froze your heart.

01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,771
The only frozen heart around here is yours.

01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,724
Wonderful!

01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,205
Setting course, sir.

01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,839
I will return this scoundrel to his country.

01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:50,761
We shall see what his twelve big brothers think of his behavior.

01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,479
Arendelle thanks you, milord.

01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,319
This is unacceptable.

01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,479
I am a victim of fear. I've been traumatized.

01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,364
Ah! My neck hurts.

01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:03,039
Is there a doctor that I could see?

01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,439
And I demand to see the queen!

01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,642
Oh. I have a message from the queen.

01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,919
"Arendelle will henceforth and forever

01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:14,045
"no longer do business of any sort with Weaseltown."

01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,239
"Weselton."

01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,799
It's Weselton!

01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,919
Come on, come on, come on!

01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,399
Okay, okay, here I come.

01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,489
Pole! - Whoops! Sorry.

01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,211
Okay, Okay.

01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,044
Here we are. Oh!

01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,363
I owe you a sled.

01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,204
Are you serious? - Yes!

01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,999
And it's the latest model.

01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,599
No, I can't accept this.

01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,565
You have to. No returns. No exchanges. Queen's orders.

01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:45,521
She's named you the Official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.

01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,519
What? That's not a thing. - Oh, sure it is.

01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:51,039
And it even has a cup holder. Do you like it?

01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:53,359
Like it? I love it!

01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,439
Whoa.

01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,290
I could kiss you!

01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,879
I could. I mean, I'd like to. I'd...

01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,079
May I? We me. I mean, may we?

01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,327
Wait, what?

01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,566
We may.

01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:09,926
Summer!

01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,799
Ooh...

01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,879
Hello.

01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:33,239
Are you ready?

01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,282
Ice!

01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:55,125
Swing me.

01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,804
Ooh...

01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,759
I like the open gates.

01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:02,122
We are never closing them again.

01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:07,127
Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful, but you know I don't skate.

01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:08,731
Come on! You can do it!

01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,359
Look out. Reindeer coming through.

01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,119
I got it, I got it. I don't got it, I don't got it.

01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,199
Hey, guys!

01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,519
That's it, Olaf.

01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,839
Glide and pivot. And glide and pivot.
