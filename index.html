      00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
      The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
      Der Schnee glänzt weiß auf den Bergen heut Nacht,
      The snow shines white on the mountains tonight,

      00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
      not a footprint to be seen
      keine Spuren sind zu sehen
      no traces are seen

      00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
      A kingdom of isolation,
      Ein einsames Königreich,
      A lonely kingdom,

      00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
      and it looks like I'm the queen
      und ich bin die Königin
      and I'm the queen

      00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
      The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
      Der Wind, er heult so wie der Sturm ganz tief in mir
      The wind blows like the storm deep inside me

      00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
      Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
      Mich zu kontrollieren, ich hab' es versucht
      I've tried to control myself

      00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
      Don't let them in, don't let them see
      Lass sie nicht rein! Lass sie nicht sehen...
      Don't let them in! Don't let them see...

      00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
      Be the good girl you always had to be
      wie du bist - nein! Das darf niemals geshehen.
      what kind of person you are - no, it can't happen.

      00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
      Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
      Du darfst nichts fühlen, zeig ihnen nicht
      You can't feel anything, don't show them

      00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
      Well, now they know!
      dein wahres ich!
      your true self!

      00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
      Let it go, let it go!
      Ich lass los, lass jetzt los!
      I'm letting go, letting go now!

      00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
      Can't hold it back any more!
      Die Kraft sie ist grenzenlos
      The power that is boundless

      00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
      Let it go, let it go!
      Ich lass los, lass jetzt los!
      I'm letting go, letting go now!

      00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
      Turn away and slam the door!
      Und ich schlag die Türen zu!
      And I'm slamming the doors shut!

      00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
      I don't care what they're going to say
      Es ist Zeit, nun bin ich bereit!
      It's time, now I'm prepared!

      00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
      Let the storm rage on
      Und ein Sturm zieht auf
      And a storm is coming

      00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
      The cold never bothered me anyway.
      Die Kälte, sie ist nun ein Teil von mir.
      And cold is now a part of me.

      00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
      It's funny how some distance
      Es ist schon eigenartig,
      It's already strange,

      00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
      Makes everything seem small
      wie klein jetzt alles scheint
      how small everything now appears

      00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
      And the fears that once controlled me
      Und die Ängste die in mir waren,
      And the fears that were in me,

      00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
      Can't get to me at all!
      kommen nicht mehr an mich ran!
      aren't able to reach me any more!

      00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
      It's time to see what I can do
      Was ich wohl alles machen kann
      What I can do everything well

      00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
      To test the limits and break through
      Die Kraft in mir treibt mich voran
      The power in me drives me forwards

      00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
      No right, no wrong, no rules for me
      Was hinter mir liegt ist vorbei
      What lies behind me is over

      00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
      I'm free!
      Endlich frei!
      Finally free!

      00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,500
      Let it go, let it go!
      Ich lass los, lass jetzt los!
      I'm letting go, letting go now!

      00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
      I am one with the wind and sky
      Nun bin ich endlich so weit!
      Now I'm finally ready!

      00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,000
      Let it go, let it go!
      Ich lass los, lass jetzt los!
      I'm letting go, letting go now!

      00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
      You'll never see me cry
      Doch Tränen seht ihr nicht!
      Yet you don't see tears!

      00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,500
      Here I stand, and here I'll stay,
      Hier bin ich und bleibe hier!
      Here I am and staying here!

      00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
      Let the storm rage on...
      Und ein Sturm zieht auf...
      And a storm is coming...

      00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
      My power flurries through the air and to the ground
      Ich spüre diese Kraft sie ist ein Teil von mir
      I feel this power that is a part of me

      00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
      My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
      Sie fließt in meine Seele und in all die Schönheit hier
      It flows in my soul and in all the beauty here

      00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
      And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
      Nur ein Gedanke und die Welt wird ganz aus Eis
      Just one thought and the world will completely turn into ice

      00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
      I'm never going back
      Ich geh nie mehr zurück
      I will never go back

      00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
      The past is in the past!
      Das ist Vergangenheit!
      It's past!

      00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
      Let it go, let it go!
      Ich bin frei, endlich frei!
      I'm free, finally free!

      00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
      And I'll rise like the break of dawn
      Und ich fühl mich wie neugeboren
      And I feel like a newborn

      00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
      Let it go, let it go!
      Ich bin frei, endlich frei!
      I'm free, finally free!

      00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
      That perfect girl is gone
      Was var ist jetzt vorbei
      What was then is now over

      00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,500
      Here I stand in the light of day
      Hier bin ich, in dem hellem Licht
      Here I am, in the bright light

      00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
      Let the storm rage on!
      Und ein Sturm zieht auf!
      And a storm is coming!

      00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500

      See the snow sparkle on the mountain tonight

      00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
      not a footprint to be seen
      Ekkert fótspor hér að sjá
      No footprints here to see

      00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
      A kingdom of isolation,
      Eitt einsemdar konungsríki
      A kingdom of isolation

      00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
      and it looks like I'm the queen
      Og ég virðist, drottningin
      And I seem to be, the Queen

      00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
      The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
      Vindurinn gnauðar eins og ólgan inni í mér
      The wind blows like the turbulence inside of me

      00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
      Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
      Gat ei byrgt það inni en ég reyndi samt
      Couldn't keep it in, but I still tried

      00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000

      Can't get to me at all!
      Virðist missa allan mátt
      Seems to lose all its power

      00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000

      I have to see what I can do

      00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
      To test the limits and break through
      Og reyná verk mín umtalsvert
      And experience my powers pretty much

      00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
      No right, no wrong, no rules for me
      Og boð og bönn ei halda mér

      My soul is upside down out of frozen fractals made

      00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
      And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
      Ein hugsun kristalla sem ískalt sprengigos
      [One thought that icy crystals explosive]
