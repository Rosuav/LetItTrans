00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not a footprint to be seen

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
and it looks like I'm the queen

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't let them in, don't let them see

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, now they know!

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let it go, let it go!

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can't hold it back any more!

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Let it go, let it go!

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Turn away and slam the door!

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't care what they're going to say

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Let the storm rage on

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cold never bothered me anyway.

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
It's funny how some distance

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Makes everything seem small

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can't get to me at all!

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
It's time to see what I can do

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
To test the limits and break through

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
No right, no wrong, no rules for me

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm free!

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Let it go, let it go!

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I am one with the wind and sky

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Let it go, let it go!

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll never see me cry

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Let the storm rage on...

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
My power flurries through the air and to the ground

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm never going back

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
The past is in the past!

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Let it go, let it go!

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And I'll rise like the break of dawn

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Let it go, let it go!

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
That perfect girl is gone

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Here I stand in the light of day

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the storm rage on!

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
The cold never bothered me anyway.
